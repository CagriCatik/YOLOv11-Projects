# Setting Up a New Project on Roboflow

## Introduction
In today’s session, we will explore how to set up a new deep learning project on the Roboflow platform. Roboflow is an invaluable tool for machine learning and deep learning projects, especially those involving computer vision tasks such as object detection, classification, and segmentation. 

This tutorial will guide you step-by-step through the process of creating a project on Roboflow, with our example being a web intrusion detection project using YOLO (You Only Look Once), a popular object detection algorithm.

## Step 1: Create a Roboflow Account
1. **Visit the Roboflow Website**: Go to [Roboflow’s official website](https://roboflow.com/).
2. **Sign Up**: If you are new to Roboflow, create an account by following the registration process.
3. **Login**: Once registered, log in to access the Roboflow dashboard.

## Step 2: Create a New Project
1. **Select “New Project”**: After logging in, look for the option to create a new project on your dashboard.
2. **Name Your Project**: 
   - Enter a descriptive project name. In our case, we’ll name it **Intrusion Detection**.
   - Using descriptive names helps in project organization and collaboration.

3. **Choose a License**: Roboflow offers various licensing options, allowing you to control how your dataset and trained models can be used and shared. Select an appropriate license that fits your project’s requirements.

4. **Define the Annotation Group**:
   - Define the group or label you’ll use for annotating objects within your images.
   - For our example, we’ll use a class named “Intrusion” as we are focusing on identifying intrusions.

## Step 3: Select the Project Type
Roboflow supports multiple project types, each suited to different machine learning tasks. Based on your project requirements, choose one of the following:

- **Object Detection**: Identify and localize specific objects within images.
- **Classification**: Categorize images into predefined classes without requiring location data.
- **Instance Segmentation**: Detect and segment each individual instance of objects in images.
- **Keypoint Detection**: Identify specific points or features within objects.
- **Image + Text**: Combine visual and textual data for multimodal tasks.
- **Semantic Segmentation**: Classify each pixel in the image according to the object it belongs to.

In this example, **select “Object Detection”** as our project involves detecting and locating intrusions.

## Step 4: Create the Project
1. **Create Public or Private Project**: Roboflow provides options to make your project public or private. For collaborative projects or open datasets, choose public. If privacy is essential, select the private project option.
2. **Finalize**: Click “Create Project” to save the settings and initialize your project on Roboflow.

Your new project is now successfully set up on Roboflow! You are ready to start uploading and preparing your dataset for training.

## Next Steps
In our upcoming class, we will focus on **dataset creation**. We will go over how to gather, upload, and annotate data for our intrusion detection model. Robust data preparation is crucial to training effective models, so ensure you are familiar with today’s project setup process.

Thank you, and see you in the next session!
